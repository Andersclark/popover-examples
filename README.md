# Dialog and Popover Examples

By Anders ([Clark](https://github.com/Andersclark) || [Ringqvist](https://github.com/anddoutoi))

## What is this?

In 2022 the `<dialog>` html element received widespread support in all major browsers. The `popover` property received the same in April 2024. These features help make modals, popups, context-menus, tooltips and more accessible, performant and MUCH less reliant on Javascript. 

This repository contains some explorations into how to use the Popover API as well as the `<dialog>` element, which overlaps in function somewhat.
